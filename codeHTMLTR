<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p>
<p>The BoW application is described as being a Web tool capable to manage information related to a botanical garden. The users - which can use the application both in anonymous mode or using a login via social networks - will be offered different means of consultation and data management for the exhibits. Some of the information provided could be: the popular/scientific name, the origin and the location on the territory, the main characteristics (such as: the addiction climate or soil), the manner of propagation (such as: seeds, seedling), identifying images available both locally or on other servers, period of cultivation, varieties or other related information.</p>
